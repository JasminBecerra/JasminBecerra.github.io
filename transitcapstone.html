					For our undergraduate geography colloquium at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, three of my peers and I worked on a semester-long research project colminating in a final public presentation and a collaboratively written thesis. Meg, Grace, Carly, and I landed on exploring whether there is a relationship between access to public transportation and access to health and well-being in Chicago.

Abstract:
This project explores access to public transportation in the city of Chicago
through the Chicago Transit Authority’s light-rail train network, referred to as the
‘L’. Using this network, we investigated the correlation between areas lacking
transit access, or “transit deserts,” in relation to health and well-being throughout
the city. To identify this correlation, we identified and mapped four public health
and well-being indicators across the city: pharmacies, green space, government
assisted food programs, and public technology. These maps were compiled, and
census tracts were grouped to determine Key Underserved Areas (KUAs), which
indicated that that parts of the city are lacking access to both public
transportation and well-being resources. With these findings, we were able to
articulate that populations that lacked access to public transit were also often
populations lacking access to public health and well-being indicators. These
populations largely consisted of ethnic minority and low-income Chicago
residents. Lastly, we reviewed plans of CTA improvement and development, and
discussed their benefits and shortcomings, in regards to better serving our KUAs
in the city of Chicago.
